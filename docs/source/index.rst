Manim Voiceover
===============

`Manim Voiceover <https://voiceover.manim.community>`__ is a `Manim <https://manim.community>`__ plugin for all things voiceover:

- Add voiceovers to Manim videos *directly in Python* without having to use a video editor.
- Record voiceovers with your microphone during rendering with a simple command line interface (see :py:class:`~manim_voiceover.services.recorder.RecorderService`).
- Develop animations with auto-generated AI voices from various free and proprietary services.
- Per-word timing of animations, i.e. trigger animations at specific words in the voiceover, even for the recordings. This works thanks to `OpenAI Whisper <https://github.com/openai/whisper>`__.
