Manim Voiceover
===============

`Manim Voiceover <https://voiceover.manim.community>`__ is a `Manim <https://manim.community>`__ plugin for all things voiceover:

- Add voiceovers to Manim videos *directly in Python* without having to use a video editor.
- Develop an animation with an auto-generated AI voice without having to re-record and re-sync the audio.
- Record a voiceover and have it stitched back onto the video instantly. (Note that this is not the same as AI voice cloning)
