Installation
============

Install Manim Voiceover from PyPI with the extras ``azure`` and ``gtts``:

.. code:: sh

   pip install "manim-voiceover[azure,gtts]"

Check whether your installation works correctly:

.. code:: sh

   wget https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim-voiceover/raw/main/examples/gtts-example.py
   manim -pql gtts-example.py --disable_caching

.. important::
   Manim needs to be called with the ``--disable_caching`` flag due to a `bug <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/907>`__.
   Don't forget to include it every time you render.

`The example above <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim-voiceover/blob/main/examples/gtts-example.py>`__ uses
`gTTS <https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/>`__ which calls the Google
Translate API and therefore needs an internet connection to work. If it
throws an error, there might be a problem with your internet connection
or the Google Translate API.

Installing PortAudio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manim Voiceover lets you record voiceovers during rendering using `PyAudio <https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/>`__.
PyAudio depends on `PortAudio <http://www.portaudio.com/>`__ which needs to be installed separately.

On Debian based distros:

.. code:: sh

   sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
   sudo pip install pyaudio
   # Or install from apt globally:
   sudo apt install python3-pyaudio

On macOS, you can install it using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__:

.. code:: sh

   brew install portaudio
   pip install pyaudio

On Windows, PortAudio should come prepackaged with the binaries, so just install PyAudio with pip:

.. code:: sh

   python -m pip install pyaudio

For more information, see the `PyAudio documentation <https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/#downloads>`__.

Installing SoX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manim Voiceover can make the output from speech synthesizers faster
or slower using `SoX <http://sox.sourceforge.net/>`__ (version 14.4.2 or
higher is required).

Install SoX on Mac with Homebrew:

.. code:: sh

   brew install sox

Install SoX (and a necessary mp3 handler) on Debian based distros:

.. code:: sh

   sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all

Or install `from
source <https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/files/sox/>`__.

Installing gettext
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manim Voiceover uses `gettext <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>`__ to
store and fetch translations of voiceover text. If you plan to translate
your videos automatically, you need to install gettext.

On Debian based distros:

.. code:: sh

   sudo apt install gettext

On macOS, you can install it using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__:

.. code:: sh

   brew install gettext
